A unix Shell program interpretes users command that can be inputted by
the user or also from a file which includes shell scripts in it.

Shell scripts are interprited not compiles. Python also interpretes the
python scripts. shell and pythons are called scripts as they are interpreted
not compiled.

┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ echo "$SHELL"                                             
/usr/bin/zsh

to know which shells are used in your system we can use "echo "%$SHELL"" command 
that will show the directory path of the default/comanding shell. To see other 
shells that are installed the unix system we have to cat the /etc/shells file.
That will show the shell scripting languages name in the file

As here is an example:

┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ cat /etc/shells                                          
# /etc/shells: valid login shells
/bin/sh
/usr/bin/sh
/bin/bash
/usr/bin/bash
/bin/rbash
/usr/bin/rbash
/bin/dash
/usr/bin/dash
/usr/bin/tmux
/bin/zsh
/usr/bin/zsh
/usr/bin/pwsh
/opt/microsoft/powershell/7/pwsh
/usr/bin/screen
                                                                                                     
To make a shell file we use filename.sh as the file name and that works perfectly 
and we are going to learn in BASH shell scripting language which is also known as
Bourne Again Shell.

To run every .sh file in your system, we can use the chmod command for every one 
of them. like;

┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/Shell_Scripting]
└─$ chmod u+x Starting.txt 
                                                                                                     
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/Shell_Scripting]
└─$ chmod u+x 01_first_shell.sh
